Experiment: GitHub-Hosted Curriculum via Markdeep
==================================================

Can we find a way to jettison GitBook, switch to the more powerful Markdeep language, and host it
for free on GitHub? Yup!

See the [APCSA Curriculum Sketch] for an intermediate version of the converted curriculum using
Markdeep.

This experiment uses a snapshot of the APCSA curriculum as of 2018-07-30. This means that it lacks
all changes since 2018-07-12, commit 3d4ec5d (git tag `markdeep-lab-base`).

You can find information about Markdeep at http://casual-effects.com/markdeep/.
