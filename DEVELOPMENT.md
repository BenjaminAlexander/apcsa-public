AP Computer Science A Curriculum Development
====================================================================================================

This project contains the source for the TEALS AP Computer Science A Curriculum. Content can be
browsed in the following ways:

- [On GitBook] — The official source for the book
- [On GitHub] — From the repository contents on GitHub
- [Locally] – From a local clone of the development repository


Versioning
----------
For purposes of versioning, we will be using _major_._minor_._patch_ notation. For now, we'll keep
the exact definitions of each fuzzy, which is particularly appropriate given that we're mostly
talking about documentation as opposed to software (what's a “breaking change” in documentation?).
Versions will come up with Git tags, change logs, and possibly releases (such as zip archives).

Generally, _patch_ numbers increase on minor updates, such as formatting, typos, or minor content
updates.

_Minor_ numbers increase as new content is added.

_Major_ number increase as content undergoes a large-scale update. For example, when the repo has
finished conversion from Word & PowerPoint curriculum content, we'll upgrade from 1.x.x to 2.0.0.
