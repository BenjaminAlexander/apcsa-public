Lesson 1.01 — Using Eclipse & Practice-It
====================================================================================================

_N.B. THIS LESSON IS OPTIONAL_

Objectives Students will be able to…
-   **Describe** one or more careers related to computer science and technology.
-   **Ask** intelligent questions about the field of computer science.
-   **Identify** 'next steps' to learn more about computer science
-   **List** the class expectations and what is required of them.

Assessments Students will...
-   **Demonstrate** Plug-In and Un-Plug procedures
-   **Log in and submit** a sample problem in Practice-It

Homework Students will...
-   **Visit** pokemon.com and play a few games or **play** Pokémon on a gaming system
-   **Visit** bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net to familiarize yourself with the Pokémon franchise


Materials & Prep
================

-   **Projector and computer**

-   **Student Computers** with Eclipse installed

-   **Classroom copies** of WS 1.1.2

-   **USB Drives** for each student (if applicable to school)

-   **Handout/Slide Deck** demonstrating file submission procedure

-   *If your school does not have a designated IT specialist available to install Eclipse on the classroom computers, **WS 1.1.1** offers step-by-step installation directions, with screenshots. If your students have computers at home, or if your school loans them laptops for homework and labs, you can print out copies of WS 1.1.1 for your students so they can install Eclipse on their home computers.*

-   *If your school distributes USB drives, model best practices by **wearing your USB drive** on your ID lanyard or keychain. Students will lose and/or forget their drives unless they are attached to another object they use daily!*

-   *Since all instructors have different preferences and requirements for file uploads/sharing, we have not included a procedure for file submission. You should prepare a handout or slide deck **demonstrating your procedure for submitting work**, and have students send you a sample file to assess understanding of your procedure. 10 minutes of this lesson have been reserved for you to teach these procedures.*

Procedure
=========

Bell-work and Attendance \[5 minutes\]
--------------------------------------

Classroom Introduction \[20 minutes\]
-------------------------------------

1. Using the slide deck as a base (edit the deck to fit your needs):

-   Poll your class to learn their names, experience, and rationale behind taking the course.

-   Go over background information of the computer science field.

-   Go over class expectations and information.

-   Touch on school requirements (varies) e.g. syllabus.

2. Class icebreakers (varies school to school).

Plug-In & Un-Plug Procedure \[10 minutes\]
------------------------------------------

1. Using WS 1.1.2, model the steps for:

-   Opening Eclipse and a workspace

-   Creating and saving a program

-   Ejecting the USB (if applicable)

2. Have students demonstrate the Plug In and Un-Plug procedures for you before you move on to the Practice It exercise.

If your classroom has a projector hooked up to the teacher’s computer, project each step as you model it for the students.

Wait until all students have completed a step before moving on to another step.

Expect this exercise to take 10 minutes or longer.

Practice-It \[10 minutes\]
--------------------------

1. Using WS 1.1.2, model the steps for creating a Practice-It account. Since you will probably already have an account, select a student account to use as a model.

2. Have all students submit a Practice It problem to demonstrate that they know how to use Practice It.

Wait until all students have completed a step before moving on to another step.

If you have extra time in class, introduce a “Scavenger Hunt” on Practice It, and have students find:

-   Where their account information is located

-   Where a record of their completed problems are located

-   Where the 3rd Self-Check problem for Chapter 7 is located

File Submission Procedure \[10 minutes\]
----------------------------------------

1. Demonstrate your procedure for file submission. Use a handout or slide deck to illustrate this procedure.

2. Have students send a sample file to assess understanding of the procedure.

Accommodation and Differentiation
=================================

Allow students to work in pairs if they are having trouble understanding the directions. Encourage pairs to model the correct procedure for each other. Student helpers should point to areas on the screen rather than typing or using the mouse to complete the action.
