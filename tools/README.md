Tools
====================================================================================================

- [Pandoc] — Used initially to convert Word documents to GitHub-flavored Markdown
- [Grip] — Very helpful utility to render local Markdown pages as they're being developed
- [DocTo] — A tool to convert Word documents to PDF. Helpful for non-Markdown assets

Though it's no longer needed, the `tools` directory contains the installer for the version of
`pandoc` used in the initial conversion of this content.
